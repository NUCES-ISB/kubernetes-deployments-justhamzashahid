# Replica Set Investigation

## Current Configuration
- Default replicas: 2 (as set in flask-deployment.yaml)
- Current implementation uses Deployment without HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)

## Testing Boundaries
1. Minimum Replicas:
   - Tested setting replicas to 0: Not recommended as it takes down the service
   - Practical minimum: 1 replica to maintain service availability
   
2. Maximum Replicas:
   - Limited by cluster resources (CPU, Memory)
   - Tested up to 4 replicas successfully
   - Can be increased based on:
     - Node resources availability
     - Application resource requirements
     - Load balancing needs

## Recommendations
1. Minimum Replicas:
   - Keep minimum 2 replicas for high availability
   - Ensures service continuity during updates/restarts

2. Maximum Replicas:
   - Set based on:
     - Expected load
     - Resource availability
     - Performance requirements
   - Consider implementing HPA for dynamic scaling

## Test Results
- Successfully scaled from 1 to 4 replicas
- Deployment maintained stability during scaling operations
- Service remained accessible throughout scaling tests
